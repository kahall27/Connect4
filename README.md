<h1>Connect Four</h1>
<h2>About the Project:</h2>
This project was written entirely in Python. It's a simple script that I wrote to practice my earliest programming skills. It was good practice as I started to learn to think like a programmer, and it was a fun project to work on!
<br />
<h2> How to Play:</h2>
1. Player 1 always goes first. <br />
2. Player 1 places their token in any column they choose (A - G). The token will fall until it reaches the bottom of the game board, or it hits an already placed token. <br />
3. Player 2 now places their token in any column. <br />
4. If either player successfully places four tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, they are the winner. If not, it is the next player's turn. <br />
5. The players may chose to play again, and clear the board, or they may chose to end the game and terminate the program. <br />
